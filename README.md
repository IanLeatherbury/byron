## Getting started

### In Terminal

### In Zeplin
Go to a project (extensions are project-specific)
Extensions > Manage Extensions
Hold down `alt` key > Manage Extension button changes to "Add Local Extension", click it!
Enter "http://localhost:7070/manifest.json" (it should prepopulate with this)

That's it!
